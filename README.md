This data science project, which focuses on eating habits, is a meticulous exploration of the food choices we make on a daily basis. The main objective is to create an intelligent recipe generator, a tool that goes beyond the simple composition of ingredients to become a personalised ally in the kitchen. By exploring data relating to consumption habits, the project aims to decipher food trends, individual preferences and specific diets. Analysis of this data will provide valuable information for designing a recipe generator that adapts to the nutritional needs and daily objectives of each user.

For example, the generator could take into account dietary restrictions, personal preferences, calorie targets and even time constraints. By combining these elements, the tool could propose personalised, balanced and delicious recipes, encouraging healthy food choices that are adapted to each individual's lifestyle. At the same time, data analysis could highlight nutritional gaps in current eating habits, offering insights for the creation of recipes that fill these specific gaps.

Beyond simply recommending recipes, the project aims to provide educational information on nutrition, offering users in-depth knowledge of the benefits of each ingredient and making a positive impact on their daily lives. The initiative aims to empower individuals, guiding them towards informed food choices while celebrating diversity and personalisation within the culinary arts.
